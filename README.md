### Project Description
The Smart Face Recognition Doorbell is a security system designed to identify and differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar visitors in real time. Using a camera installed at the door, the system captures the visitor’s image and compares it against a stored database of known faces using machine learning-based facial recognition.

### The Problem statement
Homeowners face security risks from unknown visitors and lack a real-time, intelligent system to identify familiar and unfamiliar people at their door. The project aims to provide a smart doorbell that detects, recognizes, and alerts users instantly.

### The Solution
A smart doorbell system that uses facial recognition to identify visitors, instantly alerting homeowners via a mobile app, SMS, or web interface, ensuring real-time security and easy monitoring of familiar and unfamiliar faces

**Application Workflow:**

Face Recognition Model

Large ML models on CPU are slow.

Running predictions on every frame can lag the app.

Image Transfer

Sending high-res images to the backend every few seconds eats bandwidth.

Backend Processing

If your server processes images synchronously, it will block responses.

Frontend Rendering

Continuously updating the video feed with heavy components can freeze UI.
